# How to collect information for member relations

## Introduction

This guide outlines the information points that Foundation for Public Code staff use to map member relations.

The information collected will be used to structure and keep track of our ongoing relationships with members. 

It is based on our mission and the first iterations of the founding member proposal template. In line with our communication principles, this should be concise and hypertextual where possible. 

As information collected may include personal or sensitive information, this is not public but stored in a private and secure environment.

## Information collected

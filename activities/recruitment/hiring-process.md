# Process for recruiting and hiring candidates

## Roles in this process:

* Head of human resources (HRM), responsible for the hiring process 
* Chief Executive (CEO), responsible for who we hire
* Chief Operations (COO), responsible for how this person works in the organisation
* Directors Foundation for Public Code (BOD), responsible for oversight
 
## Announcing job opening:

1. Place job posting(s) on website
2. Bring job opening(s) under the attention of network of current team (via mail, LinkedIn, social media)
3. Bring job opening(s) under the attention of the job opening(s) via (specialized) sites and possibly bureaus

## Processing reactions of people expressing interest:

4. Questions about the content of the position: route to CEO for answering
5. Questions about the procedure and the conditions: route to HRM for answering
6. Applications are sent to HRM, for processing

## Planned recruitment and hiring process:

7. Current job openings have no closing date and applications are considered on a rolling basis. When we find a suitable candidate, we hire and close the opening. This means applications are considered ‘by themselves’ and not ‘in competition’ with a certain set of other applications.
8. HRM confirms receipt to candidates and does first ‘sorting out’.
9. HRM brings possibly suitable candidates to the attention of CEO en supervisor. These 2 make +/- judgement, without consulting each other. If judgement is not equal, a short discussion follows and judgement is made.
10. HRM notifies candidates (thank you or invitation for interview).
11. First interview: CEO and HRM, 1 hr, partially on the basis of a pre-established list of desirable competences and other characteristics (i.e. fit for role, fit for organisation (culture, growth, leadership, long/short term)). Half of the interview is spent on presenting PublicCode.net, in the other half, the candidate has a change to present herself/himself. Immediately after the interview both HRM and CEO sore the candidate on the items on the list and determine if the candidate should progress to a second interview.
12. Second interview: COO (same person as above) with HRM, also partially based on a pre-established list, and with attention to the particularities and matters not discussed in the first interview. Approximately. 80-90% of the time is spent on questioning the candidate. Immediately  after the interview both M and B/C score the candidate, based on the list and other impressions gathered. HRM takes this input to CEO and HRM and CEO determine if the candidate should receive an offer.
13. CEO & HRM determination of the offer and the bandwidth of the conditions.
14. Third interview, hopefully a formality, of the preferred candidate with a BOD member (of the legal entity hiring).
15. HRM makes the offer to the candidate and negotiates, always in consultation with CEO and the director(s).
16. Signing of contract and starting by the new team member, supervised by their hierarchical supervisor.
